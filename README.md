# End-to-End Customer Churn Analysis 

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analysis workflow** for predicting customer churn.  
From **data preprocessing and exploratory analysis** to **dashboard visualization and machine learning**, the goal is to identify customers likely to churn and provide **proactive retention strategies** for businesses.

## 🎯 Business Problem
Customer churn directly impacts revenue and growth.  
By predicting which customers are likely to leave, businesses can take **targeted actions** (discounts, loyalty programs, personalized outreach) to improve retention and reduce losses.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost  
- **SQL**: data extraction & transformation  
- **Power BI**: interactive dashboards & business insights  
- **Joblib**: model saving & deployment  

## 🔍 Steps Followed
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – handled missing values, encoded categorical features, feature scaling.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – visualized churn patterns, correlations, and customer behavior.  
3. **Dashboarding** – built a **Power BI dashboard** to track churn KPIs.  
4. **Model Training** – applied ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression).  
5. **Model Evaluation** – compared performance using **F1-score** (best suited for imbalanced datasets).  
6. **Insights & Recommendations** – identified ~400 customers at risk of churn and suggested proactive retention strategies.  

## 📊 Key Results
- **Best Model**: Random Forest / XGBoost (tested & compared)  
- **Evaluation Metric**: F1-score for churn class  
- **Business Insight**: ~400 customers flagged as high churn risk
